# MIS321-group-project
<h1>Requirements | Hello</h1>
<p><strong>Make sure yall save the <u>pulled repository</u> to your local machine <u>before making any changes and pushing them</u>. We all need to be responsible for having an extra non-edited project folder everytime we pull from the repo!!! This is so if anyone pushes a project with errors, we have the backup.</strong></p>

<h2>Dotnet</h2>
<p>Make sure you have dotnet 8. My version is 8.0.4</p>
<p>Run the following commands in your console (make sure in api folder). You might not need to since I technically uploaded the files... idk. Better safe than sorry.</p>
<ul>
  <li>dotnet new webapi --use-controllers</li>
  <li>dotnet add package MySqlConnector</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task List</h2>
<p>I'm going to create a task list after our next meeting with the exec once we actually start coding. Everytime we pull/push from the repo, we will document it in this list so we know what all transactions have happened. We will put the pull/push info and a detailed description of what we did.</p>

<h2>Comment Your Code</h2>
<p>I haven't looked at yalls code, but comment every line. You should already be in that habit, but we need to know whats going on when someone else makes a push. The more descriptive, the better - even with the most simple code.</p>
